### Banality of Evil
Human Expenditure Program explores Hannah Arendt's concept of the "banality of evil" - how ordinary people can become complicit in harmful systems through routine administrative work, bureaucratic processes, and institutional pressure.

### Dehumanization Through Systems
The game demonstrates how institutional structures can create psychological distance between decision-makers and the human consequences of their choices, turning people into numbers and cases to be processed.

### Moral Agency in Institutions
Players confront the challenge of maintaining moral agency while operating within systems designed to suppress individual judgment in favor of institutional goals and efficiency metrics.

### Language as Control
The game explores how euphemistic language and administrative jargon can obscure moral reality, making harmful actions seem routine, necessary, or even beneficial.
